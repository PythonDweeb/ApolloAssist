## üìú Project Overview
Similar to Apple's weather app, Apollo Assist aims to provide an interactive visualization of geomagnetic disturbances and their impact across multiple domains. By utilizing real-time data from NASA's DONKI API, users can monitor and analyze key space weather metrics, track events over time, view a 3D models, and access a fast inference RAG model to perform further analysis.

## üí° Key Features
- **Real-Time Space Weather Data**: Fetches Geomagnetic Storm (GST), Solar Flare (FLR), and Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) data from NASA‚Äôs DONKI API.
- **3D Geomagnetic Disturbance Visualization**: View an interactive heatmap of geomagnetic disturbances overlaid on a global map.
- **Impact Analysis**: Details the effect of space weather on various professions, from pilots and astronauts to satellite operators and power grid workers.
- **Dynamic Dashboard with Key Metrics**: Includes gauge charts and time series to track storm durations, Kp indices, and solar flare/cme counts.
- **Fast Inference RAG Based Voice Assistant Model**: Access a highly specialized RAG model to assist in mitigating radiation effects and general queries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, HTML, CSS, Javascript
- **Backend**: Python (Pandas, Requests, Numpy)
